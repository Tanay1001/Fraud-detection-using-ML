# Fraud Detection Using Online Payment Data
The goal is to develop a model that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions in online payments using machine learning techniques.

## Key Features:
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and removing duplicates.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing data distributions, correlations, and transaction types.
- Model Training: ML algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Classifier.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, recall, precision, F1 score, and F-beta score.
- Visualizing ROC curves for model comparison and performance assessment.
